* Add web tracker service
** User observer pattern for service

   Implementation is abstracted inside the method `processEvent`, any
   component used should provide type of handler:

*** Client

    Event is directly from browser, server acts as a proxy

*** Server

    Event is processed by server

*** Missing unit test

    I will add it if enough time

** Event has two kinds of handler
*** Client
**** Sign-in page action
**** Welcome page action
**** Account page action
**** Properties page action
**** Issuance page action
**** Property detail page action
*** Server
**** User Location
**** Default language option
**** Browser type
**** Device
**** Traffic source
