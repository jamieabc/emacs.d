  [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1480236/does-a-tcp-socket-connection-have-a-keep-alive/33927447#33927447][reference]]

  Event socket connection opened with TCP keep-alive, it may still be
  closed.

  The ~tcp_keepalive_time~: time waits for incoming data, default ~7200~
  seconds (2 hours)

  The ~tcp_keepalive_probes~: how many times to retry after above time
  limit exceeds, default to ~9~ times. zeromq uses term ~TCP_KEEPCNT~.

  The ~tcp_keepalive_intvl~: how long to retry after first timeout,
  default to ~75~ second

** Linux

   ~cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_time~
   ~cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_probes~
   ~cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_intvl~

** Mac

   ~sysctl net.inet.tcp | grep -E "keepidle|keepintvl|keepcnt"~
