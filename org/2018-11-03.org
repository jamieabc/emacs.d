** Symbol
   [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Symbol-Type.html][reference]]

   A symbol is an object with a name. The symbol name serves as the
   printed representation of the symbol. use ~symbol-name~ to convert a
   symbol name into string.

   A symbol name starts with ~:~ is keyboard symbol, it acts as a
   constant.

   As an exception to the rule that a symbol's name serves as its
   printed representation, ~##~ is the printed representation for an
   symbol whose name is an empty string. Furthermore, ~#:foo~ is the
   printed representation for an uninterned symbol whose name is
   foo. (Normally, the Lisp reader interns all symbols; see Creating Symbols.)
