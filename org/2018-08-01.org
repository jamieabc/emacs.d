** Difference between unit test & e2e test
   If a behavior exist only within component, then it should be a unit test.

   take `app.e2e.ts` as an example

#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
it('Has title', async () => {});
it('Has header', async () => {});
#+END_SRC

   The `title` and `header` is nothing to do with backend data, so
   after some thinkg, it shold be in the unit test better. And for
   unit test, it is much faster and even shadow dom test can be introduced.
