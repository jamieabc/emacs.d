** For local chain (regression mode), ignore block hash difficulty verification
** Bitmarkd is able to generate block in regression mode
*** modify recorderd so that it can receive difficulty, judge by that provided value
*** write another dummy recorderd only for regression mode
*** modify bitmarkd internal mechanism to generate regression block instantly
